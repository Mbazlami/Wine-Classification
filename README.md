# Wine-Classification
Machine learning classification problem 
---
In this problem we explore the wine dataset which is an open source dataset which can be found at Kaggle and we will try to develop a proper classifcation model that predicts what type a certain veriety of wine is. There are mainly three types of wine as defined configured by the <Name> column in the dataset, and from certain predictors that are in the dataset as well we need to develop machine learning model that accurately predicts to what type of wine with these x,y,z characteristics belong to.
